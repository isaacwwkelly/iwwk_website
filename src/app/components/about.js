        <h2>Professional Details</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a full-stack software engineer. I started my career at Dell
          Technologies as an intern and have moved up to Software Engineer II.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was recently affected by Dell's work force reductions and am now
          looking for software engineering opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this website to demonstrate some of my abilities and gain
          traction in software engineer job applications.
        </p>

      <div className="py-4">
        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <p>I work to live, not the other way around.</p>
        <p>That's why this website will not contain a portfolio of my work. </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my full-time job, I wasn't working on other projects that I
          wouldn't use, I was enjoying life away from the IDE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to spend my free time with my wife, where we go rock climbing,
          hiking, or read books together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing board
          games with friends.
